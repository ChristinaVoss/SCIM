# School Club Information Manager (SCIM)

The School Club Information Manager is an application to help schools more easily share information about their clubs. It provides easy to use interfaces to add and update clubs to the system, which are then displayed in two formats on a "parent/public" page: Timetable view and Detailed Cards view.

The admin side currently allows users to 
- manage admin users 
  - register
  - login
  - logout
  -  edit details 
  -  delete users 
  -  (further restrictions and facilities to be implemented)
- setup (and edit) manager for school specific details, including:
  - school name 
  - logo
  - colour of public banner
  - available year groups
  - future implementation should allow filter categories
- create club form
- edit club form
- list clubs
- view single clubs
- delete club form
- manage info on club staff

*Note - This is **only** an information sharing system, not a system to handle bookings. Its aim is to help schools more effectively share information about the clubs, and for parents (and school kids) to more easily access information about available clubs.*

This README and a WIKI will be updated with more details and pictures to better illustrate how the manager works. The Issues will be updated with needed improvements.
